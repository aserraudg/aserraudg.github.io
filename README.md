Visual design:

The layout is formed by two side by side div elements, both of them inside another div which is called the container. The left div is static, while the right one can be scrolled. The text is arranged in tables with rows of two columns each. The color palette is blue for the static div and lighter blue for the text on the left side of the tables. The text has white color for contrast with the blue and black and gray to give more importance to the titles.
